                        "you can not hear my words who are sheltered underneath the canopy of your wings. `are we the inhabitants you are looking for?` the nest has been left empty and i can not hear your answers anymore."  Distance: of people, of communication, of conversations, of questions and answers, of unspoken words, of longing, blurring and unfolding and overlapping. Printed on vellum, folded into a swan.
